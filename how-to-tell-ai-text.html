    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">How to Tell If Text Was Written by AI: A Practical Guide</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">In a world where AI-generated content is becoming increasingly hard to spot, being able to tell whether a piece of text was written by a human or machine is more important than ever. Whether you're an educator, content creator, or just curious, this guide will walk you through how to identify AI-written text ‚Äî and why it matters.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why It‚Äôs Getting Harder to Tell</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude have become remarkably sophisticated. They produce clean, grammatically correct sentences, adapt tone and structure to prompts, and even mimic human mistakes. This makes it incredibly hard to detect AI with the naked eye, especially for non-experts.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Red Flags in AI-Generated Text</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Overly Formal or Neutral Tone:</strong> AI often writes in a generic, polished tone ‚Äî even when the topic calls for emotion or personality.</li>
      <li><strong>Repetition and Redundancy:</strong> You might notice phrases repeated or the same idea reworded unnecessarily. AI tends to play it safe by circling back.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of Specificity:</strong> AI-generated text can be vague. It often uses placeholders or generalities rather than concrete examples or facts.</li>
      <li><strong>Strange Transitions:</strong> Look for awkward or robotic shifts between paragraphs ‚Äî these can feel mechanical or out of place.</li>
      <li><strong>No Real Point of View:</strong> Even when answering a question, AI often avoids taking a clear stance or offering nuanced opinion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Problem With Manual Detection</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">While these clues are useful, they aren‚Äôt foolproof. AI models are constantly improving, and some human writers (especially non-native speakers or very formal professionals) can exhibit similar traits. That‚Äôs where automated tools come in.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Use a Detection Tool ‚Äî Like TextDetectorAI</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Manual detection is time-consuming and unreliable at scale. That‚Äôs why we built <a href="https://www.textdetectorai.online" class="text-purple-700 font-semibold hover:underline">TextDetectorAI</a> ‚Äî a free tool that uses a specialized machine learning model trained to distinguish between human and AI writing patterns.</p>

      <li>‚úÖ <strong>Confidence score included</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Who Needs to Detect AI Text?</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Teachers and Professors:</strong> Academic integrity is at risk if essays are AI-generated.</li>
      <li><strong>Editors and Journalists:</strong> Source reliability is critical in publishing.</li>
      <li><strong>Hiring Managers:</strong> AI-written cover letters are common.</li>
      <li><strong>Researchers:</strong> Transparency matters in scholarly communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">The rise of AI-generated content is not a threat ‚Äî but it is a shift. Knowing how to spot AI text, and having the tools to do it, is a crucial skill in 2025 and beyond.</p>
