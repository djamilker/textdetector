    <p class="mb-4">With the rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, it's becoming harder to tell if the text you're reading was written by a human or a machine. Here are the top five signs that you're likely reading AI-generated content — and what to do about it.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Repetitive Phrasing</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">AI often repeats words, sentence structures, or even entire ideas. If you notice unnatural repetition, it could be a sign the content was machine-generated.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Lack of Personal Experience or Emotion</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">AI doesn't have feelings or memories. If a text avoids personal stories, opinions, or genuine emotion, it may have been written by a bot.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Overuse of Generalizations</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Phrases like "In today's world" or "Many people believe" are classic AI fillers. While humans do use generalizations, AI tends to rely on them excessively to sound authoritative.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Too Polished or "Safe"</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">AI-generated writing often avoids strong stances, edgy humor, or controversial takes. It may read like it’s been smoothed over for maximum neutrality.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. It Sounds Good — But Says Very Little</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">One major red flag is content that flows well but lacks depth or insight. If you finish reading and realize you didn’t learn anything new, there’s a chance it was AI-generated.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Want a Shortcut?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Instead of guessing, use <a href="/" class="text-purple-700 font-semibold underline">TextDetectorAI.online</a> to analyze any block of text instantly. Our tool uses real machine learning models to tell if a piece of writing is AI or human-written — so you can stop guessing.</p>
